# Credit-Card-Checker-Luhn-Algorithm
A challenge project that required me to translate the Luhn Algorithm into code using vanilla JS.

The Algorithm is pasted below.

Throughout the project, I've also had to isolate the invalid numbers. Once they were isolated, I identified which company issuied those invalid numbers. (Visa, Amex, etc.)
